As answered Bjorn, we already have the RPMsg bus to manage the rpmsg devices.
Look like duplication from my POV, except if the IOCTL does not manage channel
but only endpoint.

In my design I considered that the rpmsg_ctrl creates a channel associated to a
rpmsg_device such as the RPMsg ns_announcement.

Based on this assumption, if we implement the auxiliary_bus (or other) for the
rpmsg_ctrl a RPMsg driver will have to manage the probe by rpmsg_bus and by the
auxillary bus. The probe from the auxiliary bus would lead to the creation of an
RPMsg device on the rpmsg_bus, so a duplication with cross dependencies and
would probably make tricky the remove part.

That said, I think the design depends on the functionality that should be
implemented in the rpmsg_ctrl. Here is an alternative approach based on the
auxiliary bus, which I'm starting to think about:

The current approach of the rpmsg_char driver is to use the IOCTRL interface to
instantiate a cdev with an endpoint (the RPMsg device is associated with the
ioctl dev). This would correspond to the use of an auxiliary bus to manage local
endpoint creations.

We could therefore consider an RPMsg name service based on an RPmsg device. This
RPMsg device would register a kind of "RPMsg service endpoint" driver on the
auxiliary rpmsg_ioctl bus.
The rpmsg_ctrl will be used to instantiate the endpoints for this RPMsg device.
on user application request the rpmsg_ctrl will call the appropriate auxiliary
device to create an endpoint.

If we consider that one objective of this series is to allow application to
initiate the communication with the remote processor, so to be able to initiate
the service (ns announcement sent to the remote processor).
This implies that:
-either the RPMsg device has been probed first by a remote ns announcement or by
a Linux kernel driver using the "driver_override", to register an auxiliary
device. In this case an endpoint will be created associated to the RPMsg service
- or create a RPMsg device on first ioctl endpoint creation request, if it does
not exist (that could trig a NS announcement to remote processor).

But I'm not sure that this approach would work with QCOM RPMsg backends...

It seems to me that the main point to step forward is to clarify the global
design and features of the rpmsg-ctrl.
Depending on the decision taken, this series could be trashed and rewritten from
a blank page...To not lost to much time on the series don't hesitate to limit
the review to the minimum.

Thanks,
Arnaud
