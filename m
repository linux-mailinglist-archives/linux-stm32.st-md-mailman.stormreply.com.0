Ok, I will explain the differences with the legacy and the needs of 
sdmmc variant about busy detection.

it's exact:
MCI_STM32_BUSYD0 BIT(20): This is a hardware status flag only (inverted 
value of d0 line), it does not generate an interrupt, and so no mask
bit.

MCI_STM32_BUSYD0ENDMASK BIT(21): This indicates only end of busy
following a CMD response. On busy to Not busy changes, an interrupt
is generated (if unmask) and BUSYD0END status flag is set.
status flag is cleared by writing corresponding interrupt clear bit in 
MMCICLEAR.

like your are clarify in previous series, the busy detection is done
in 3 steps.

if I use:
.busy_detect_flag	= MCI_STM32_BUSYD0ENDMASK,
.busy_detect_mask	= MCI_STM32_BUSYD0ENDMASK,

the sdmmc request will be not correctly completed, because the third 
step can't be happen.

chronologies:
step1: when busyd0end change to 1
  => busyd0end interrupt is unmasked
  => busy_status = cmd_sent | respend
  => return to mmci_irq
step2: busyd0end is yet to 1
  => clear the busyd0end interrupt
	=> the hardware clear busyd0end status flag on interrupt clear
  => return to mmci_irq

like MCI_STM32_BUSYD0END interrupt is generated only on change
busy to not busy, when the interrupt is cleared (status is 0)
the step 3 can't happen (no irq pending to re-enter in mmci_cmd_irq).
sdmmc can't complete the request.

If I use:
.busy_detect_flag	= MCI_STM32_BUSYD0,
.busy_detect_mask	= MCI_STM32_BUSYD0ENDMASK,

Like there is no MCI_STM32_BUSYD0 irq mask, the status read in mmci_irq
"status &= readl(host->base + MMCIMASK0)" can't take account the 
busy_detect_flag (for sdmmc). So the  step 2 can't be passed.
However we could share re-read between step 1 and step 2.

proposal:

+
+		u32 busy_val = readl(base + MMCISTATUS) &
+			host->variant->busy_detect_flag;
+
  		if (!host->busy_status &&
-		    !(status & (MCI_CMDCRCFAIL|MCI_CMDTIMEOUT)) &&
-		    (readl(base + MMCISTATUS) & host->variant->busy_detect_flag)) {
+		    !(status & (MCI_CMDCRCFAIL|MCI_CMDTIMEOUT)) && busy_val) {

  			writel(readl(base + MMCIMASK0) |
  			       host->variant->busy_detect_mask,
@@ -1262,8 +1265,7 @@ mmci_cmd_irq(struct mmci_host *host, struct

  		 */
-		if (host->busy_status &&
-		    (status & host->variant->busy_detect_flag)) {
