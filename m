Your proposal is interesting, what concerns me is that seems to work only
for a first start. And calling rproc_boot, while state is RPROC_RUNNING seems
pretty strange for me.
Also, as Peng mentions in https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/11390485/,
the need also exists to skip the load of the firmware on recovery.
How to manage ROM/XIP Firmwares, no handling of the FW code only management
of the live cycle (using sysfs, crash management ....)?

Not sure to catch your point here. By "above" you mention your proposal or mine?
In my opinion, rproc->state already represents the MCU state
what seems missing is the FW state
Could you clarify what you mean by "systems where the MCU is not the life cycle
manager" MCU = rproc framework?
