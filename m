After reviewing Peng's patches it became clear to me using if/else
statements will quickly become unmanageable - we need something
flexible that can scale.  After spending a long time looking at what
TI, NXP and ST have done to address their specific needs I think a
solution is starting to take shape in my head.  From here I think the
best way to proceed is for me to write a patchset that enacts those
ideas and sent it out for review, something that should take me around
2 weeks.
