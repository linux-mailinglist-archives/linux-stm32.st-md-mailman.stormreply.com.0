Thanks for your time past on this topic!

I don't expect a clear guidance but that we clarify the objective of this RPMsg
IOCTL. A first step would be sure that we are in line with the objective of the
RPMsg IOCTL.
For instance should we continue in a way to have the rpmsg_char more "rpmsg
service" generic, relying on a rpmsg_ioctl for the control part? Or should we
implement something independent (with is own API) to limit dependency with QCOM
backends constraints?
At the end, if implementing a IOCTL interface directly in the RPMsg TTY seems to
you and Bjorn simpler, I can also go on this way...

On my side I expect to find time this week to prototype a RPMSg ioctl using the
auxiliary bus to better understand involved mechanism.

Thanks,
Arnaud
