OK

So technically , there is a possibility to handle level-sensitive
active-high interrupts. Can one such interrupt be routed through the
EXTImux into a GIC SPI then ?

How does this deal with the case where the device holds the interrupt
line low (since it's level-sensitive, active low) after the driver
interrupt handler finishes ? Does such condition generate another
interrupt and call the driver interrupt handler again ? I would expect
the answer is no, because the interrupt is edge-triggered and there is
no edge.
