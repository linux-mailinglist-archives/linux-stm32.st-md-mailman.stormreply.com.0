From: Ondrej Jirman <megous@megous.com>

This series implements support for Xunlong Orange Pi 3 board.

- ethernet support (patches 1-3)
- HDMI support (patches 4-6)

For some people, ethernet doesn't work after reboot (but works on cold
boot), when the stmmac driver is built into the kernel. It works when
the driver is built as a module. It's either some timing issue, or power
supply issue or a combination of both. Module build induces a power
cycling of the phy.

I encourage people with this issue, to build the driver into the kernel,
and try to alter the reset timings for the phy in DTS or
startup-delay-us and report the findings.


Please take a look.

thank you and regards,
  Ondrej Jirman


Changes in v7:
- dropped stored reference to connector_pdev as suggested by Jernej
- added forgotten dt-bindings reviewed-by tag

Changes in v6:
- added dt-bindings reviewed-by tag
- fix wording in stmmac commit (as suggested by Sergei)

Changes in v5:
- dropped already applied patches (pinctrl patches, mmc1 pinconf patch)
- rename GMAC-3V3 -> GMAC-3V to match the schematic (Jagan)
- changed hdmi-connector's ddc-supply property to ddc-en-gpios
  (Rob Herring)

Changes in v4:
- fix checkpatch warnings/style issues
- use enum in struct sunxi_desc_function for io_bias_cfg_variant
- collected acked-by's
- fix compile error in drivers/pinctrl/sunxi/pinctrl-sun9i-a80-r.c:156
  caused by missing conversion from has_io_bias_cfg struct member
  (I've kept the acked-by, because it's a trivial change, but feel free
  to object.) (reported by Martin A. on github)
  I did not have A80 pinctrl enabled for some reason, so I did not catch
  this sooner.
- dropped brcm firmware patch (was already applied)
- dropped the wifi dts patch (will re-send after H6 RTC gets merged,
  along with bluetooth support, in a separate series)

Changes in v3:
- dropped already applied patches
- changed pinctrl I/O bias selection constants to enum and renamed
- added /omit-if-no-ref/ to mmc1_pins
- made mmc1_pins default pinconf for mmc1 in H6 dtsi
- move ddc-supply to HDMI connector node, updated patch descriptions,
  changed dt-bindings docs

Changes in v2:
- added dt-bindings documentation for the board's compatible string
  (suggested by Clement)
- addressed checkpatch warnings and code formatting issues (on Maxime's
  suggestions)
- stmmac: dropped useless parenthesis, reworded description of the patch
  (suggested by Sergei)
- drop useles dev_info() about the selected io bias voltage
- docummented io voltage bias selection variant macros
- wifi: marked WiFi DTS patch and realted mmc1_pins as "DO NOT MERGE",
  because wifi depends on H6 RTC support that's not merged yet (suggested
  by Clement)
- added missing signed-of-bys
- changed &usb2otg dr_mode to otg, and added a note about VBUS
- improved wording of HDMI driver's DDC power supply patch
