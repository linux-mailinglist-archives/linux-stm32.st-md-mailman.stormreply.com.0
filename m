The more I look at this, the more I'm convinced this commit is
incorrect, even if it is the case that the hardware doesn't support
TSO and TBS together.

When TSO is enabled (NETIF_F_TSO set in the netif's features) then
the core net layer can submit skbuffs that need to be processed using
TSO.

If such a skbuff hits a channel that has TSO disabled (because the
above commit caused:

	stmmac_enable_tso(priv, priv->ioaddr, 1, chan);

not to be called) then the TSE bit in the transmit control register
will not be set, thereby disabling TSO on this particular channel.

However, stmmac_xmit() will still call through to stmmac_tso_xmit()
which will dutifully populate the transmit ring with descriptors that
assume TSE has been set in the transmit control register.

It seems to me _that_ is even more broken than "the hardware doesn't
support TSO and TBS together" - I have no idea what the stmmac hardware
does if it encounters descriptors with TSE set but TSE is disabled in
the transmit control register. My guess would be it would ignore the
TSE bit in the descriptor and assume that it's one very large packet
to be sent - and either error out because it's longer than the
maximum the hardware can support or it will just try to transmit it
anyway.
