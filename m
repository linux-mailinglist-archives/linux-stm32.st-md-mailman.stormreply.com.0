Has it always taken a moment to stabilise? Note that the ANE changes
will trigger a re-exchange of SGMII in-band, which is why you see
the PCS link go down and back up after the "ANE 0->1" message.

I do notice:

	qcom-ethqos 23040000.ethernet eth1: Timeout accessing MAC_VLAN_Tag_Filter

which is a symptom that a clock is missing. There's been some recent
patches merged into net-next which changes this:

2cd70e3968f5 net: stmmac: Defer VLAN HW configuration when interface is down
bd7ad51253a7 net: stmmac: Fix VLAN HW state restore
e38200e361cb net: stmmac: Improve double VLAN handling
35dfedce442c net: stmmac: Fix error handling in VLAN add and delete paths

please indicate whether you have these applied.

Great.

That's currently expected, because phylink thinks we're using PHY
mode (where it's in charge of reading the PHY and telling the MAC
what's going on) rather than using inband. This is something that
will need to be addressed later.

I think you added some debug between the logs that you've provided
below, which I'll take as not significant.

I think what's happening is the PHY's SGMII exchange times out, but
because you're enabling SGMII with AN at the PCS, the PCS is wanting
that to complete, and that never happens. I suspect if you unplug and
replug the cable after its switched into 1G mode, it may work. However,
I need to check whether AQR115C does this "AN bypass" thing.

That said, as we're using outband mode, phylink will call
phy_config_inband() with LINK_INBAND_DISABLE. This should disable
inband mode at the PHY, but from your logs I see evidence that it
hasn't. I think that may be because the AQR needs something more than
writing the VEND1_GLOBAL_CFG_* registers for that to take effect.

One of the hacks I have locally for an AQR113C on a SFP module which
uses 10GBASE-R with rate matching is the following in
aqr_gen4_config_init() to allow it to work with MACs that only support
up to 2.5G:

        phy_set_bits_mmd(phydev, MDIO_MMD_VEND1, MDIO_CTRL1, MDIO_CTRL1_LPOWER);
        mdelay(10);
        phy_write_mmd(phydev, MDIO_MMD_VEND1, 0x31a, 2);
        phy_write_mmd(phydev, MDIO_MMD_VEND1, VEND1_GLOBAL_CFG_10M,
                      VEND1_GLOBAL_CFG_AUTONEG_ENA |
                      VEND1_GLOBAL_CFG_SERDES_MODE_SGMII);
        phy_write_mmd(phydev, MDIO_MMD_VEND1, VEND1_GLOBAL_CFG_100M,
                      VEND1_GLOBAL_CFG_AUTONEG_ENA |
                      VEND1_GLOBAL_CFG_SERDES_MODE_SGMII);
        phy_write_mmd(phydev, MDIO_MMD_VEND1, VEND1_GLOBAL_CFG_1G,
                      VEND1_GLOBAL_CFG_AUTONEG_ENA |
                      VEND1_GLOBAL_CFG_SERDES_MODE_SGMII);
        phy_write_mmd(phydev, MDIO_MMD_VEND1, VEND1_GLOBAL_CFG_2_5G,
                      VEND1_GLOBAL_CFG_AUTONEG_ENA |
                      VEND1_GLOBAL_CFG_SERDES_MODE_OCSGMII);
        phy_clear_bits_mmd(phydev, MDIO_MMD_VEND1, MDIO_CTRL1,
                           MDIO_CTRL1_LPOWER);

I have this immediately after "priv->wait_on_global_cfg = true;"

This reprograms the vendor provisioning so that we use 2500BASE-X
for 2.5G and SGMII for 1G and below with AN enabled. Note placing
the PHY into low-power mode while doing this - this causes firmware
to re-read when exiting low-power mode. I wonder if that's required
in aqr_gen2_config_inband() - but that will cause the link to go
down.

Note that VEND1_GLOBAL_CFG_AUTONEG_ENA enables inband signalling on
the link.

With the above, you should be able to test various scenarios with
the PHY - and changing your provisioned 10M configuration will likely
get 10M speeds working.
