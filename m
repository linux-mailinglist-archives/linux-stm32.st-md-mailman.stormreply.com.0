There's another factor in play here: the dwmac-qcom-ethqos glue driver
forces the configuration of the stmmac integrated PCS irrespective of
what phylink wants (whether or not patch 1 is being used.) That is,
for 1G, 100M and 10M, the SGMII in-band control word must be sent by
the PHY, and it must accurately indicate the symbol replication via
the speed bits. If this is not the case, then the stmmac PCS block will
not behave correctly.

So, if the PHY says in the SGMII configuration word that its operating
at 10M, but is internally rate-adapting to 1G and sending the packet
with no symbol replication, that is outside what the stmmac PCS block
will cope with.

From the kernel messages provided, the PCS is reporting no
capabilities, but as you say, the PHY is reporting
LINK_INBAND_ENABLE | LINK_INBAND_DISABLE. The mode that phylink is
using is "phy/outband/sgmii" - so what _should_ be no in-band
signalling. However, note what I said above - for 1G, 100M and 10M,
qcom-ethqos does this:

	ethqos_pcs_set_inband(priv, true);

in its fix_mac_speed() hook, which translates to:

	stmmac_pcs_ctrl_ane(priv, true, 0);

which eventually gets through to:

	dwmac_ctrl_ane(priv, offset, true, false);

This sets GMAC_AN_CTRL_ANE | GMAC_AN_CTRL_RAN but not
GMAC_AN_CTRL_SGMRAL. This means "autoneg enable" "restart autoneg" and
!SGMRAL means that the SGMII rate adaption block operates according to
the link speed received from the PHY.

At this point, I'm not sure whether I should just rip out the
stmmac_pcs_ctrl_ane() stuff from dwmac-qcom-ethqos.c - I've been
operating on the assumption that this is working code. Maybe that's
a false assumption, and its been broken since a818bd12538c ("net:
stmmac: dwmac-qcom-ethqos: Add support for 2.5G SGMII").
