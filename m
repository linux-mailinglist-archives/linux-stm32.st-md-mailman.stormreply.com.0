It depends on how rpdev is initialized[1].
 - For the rpmsg_char no default endpoint is created. The endpoint is created on
/dev/rpmsgX open. So the channel is created but not announced.
=> both sides have to know the the destination address for virtio implementation.

- For the rpmsg TTY the endpoint should be created by default by the RPMsg core
and associated to the rpdev. An announcement is sent to the remote side.

In this first series I just focused to de-correlate the control part from the
rpmsg char. A main difference is that a channel is associated to a cdev.

But the ioctrl can be extended to close the cdev and the associated channel
(implemented in my V1).
else the rpmsg device is automatically remove by the rpmsg bus.

With the virtio implementation it is potentially already the case. When Linux
receive an NS announcement, there is no mechanism to inform the remote firmware
that Linux is ready to receive data. Some OpenAMP lib user already point out
this issue.
In glink driver seems that there is no such issue as
qcom_glink_send_open/close_req allow to provide information on endpoint state.

I would propose to address this in a next step.

I'm not familiar with auxilary-bus but seems very similar to the rpmsg_bus...
I wonder if this could lead to code duplication in RPMsg service drivers to
support the control but also the NS announcement.

or if we still only care for char and tty, not split them

The initial requirement was to extend the control interface implemented in
rpmsg_char to other services before introducing new one.

So probably as a first step we have to clarify the requirements to determine the
solution to implement.

Here is my point of view on the induced requirements:
- Allow to create a service from Linux user application:
	- with a specific name
	- with or without name service announcement.
- Allow to probe the same service by receiving either a NS announcement from the
remote firmware or a Linux user application request.
- Use these services independently of the RPMsg transport implementation (e.g be
able to use RPMSg char with the RPMsg virtio bus).

This requirements explain my approach: associate a service to a RPMsg device in
order to be able to probe using the same driver either by the remote firmware NS
announcement or by a Linux user application.

Is the requirements I detailed match with what you had in mind?

Please, could you detail your views on the use of the auxilary bus in this context?

We can also think about an alternative to keep rpmsg_char unchanged for legacy
support.
 - only create a RPMsg ctrl for new RPMsg services
 - enable it for virtio_rpmsg_bus (In this case the rpmsg char cannot be probed
by remote firmware, but allows communication between fixed addresses)

Arnaud
